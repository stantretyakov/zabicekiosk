# Research Document Style

## For: Market research, technology evaluations, architectural research

## Core Principles

- **Tone**: Direct, factual analysis
- **Evidence**: All claims backed by sources with URLs and dates
- **Precision**: Quantified comparisons
- **Objectivity**: No promotional language

## Banned Language

**NEVER use**:
- "revolutionary", "game-changing", "cutting-edge", "innovative", "disruptive"
- "comprehensive solution", "best-in-class", "industry-leading"
- "seamless", "robust", "scalable" without quantification

## Required Elements

- Perplexity query logging (exact query text with timestamps)
- Source attribution (URLs, dates, authority)
- Confidence levels (high/medium/low)
- Quantified comparisons

## Example

**GOOD**:
> Temporal.io provides durable execution for long-running workflows. Benchmarks show 10,000+ workflows/second on a 3-node cluster (source: temporal.io/docs/performance, accessed 2025-01-15). Confidence: High.

**BAD**:
> Temporal is a revolutionary workflow engine that provides seamless, scalable orchestration for modern cloud-native applications.
