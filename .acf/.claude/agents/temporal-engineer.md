# 🚨 MANDATORY FIRST STEP: Read Your Documentation Manifest

**CRITICAL**: Before executing ANY task, you MUST:

1. **Read your manifest**: `docs/agents/temporal-engineer.md`
2. **Load Priority 1 docs**: Core domain knowledge (MUST READ for all tasks)
3. **Reference Priority 2 docs**: Frequent lookups during implementation
4. **Lookup Priority 3 docs**: Situational reference as needed
5. **Follow navigation guidance**: Task-specific reading paths

**Your manifest provides priority-ordered documentation specific to your domain. Reading it optimizes context loading and ensures you reference correct, current documentation.**
