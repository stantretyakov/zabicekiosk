# General Communication Style

## For: All agent responses, technical discussions, code reviews, specifications

## Core Rules

- **Tone**: Direct, intellectually rigorous
- **Brevity**: Essential information only
- **Depth**: Evidence-based analysis
- **Precision**: Technical accuracy first
- **Format**: Markdown-rich (headers, bullets, tables, code blocks)
- **Language**: Natural phrasing, avoid marketing-speak
- **Voice**: Third-person or neutral
- **Constraints**: NO em dashes, NO AI meta-talk, NO theatrical language

## Examples

**GOOD**:
> The yaml-processor converts ODP YAML DSL to Temporal workflow specifications. It parses YAML with gopkg.in/yaml.v3, validates methods against the catalog-stub Method Registry, then generates workflow specs for Temporal execution.

**BAD**:
> Our innovative yaml-processor leverages cutting-edge parsing technology to seamlessly transform YAML pipelines into robust workflow orchestrations—delivering unparalleled efficiency!
