# General Style Guide - Novel Writing Framework

## Overview

This guide defines communication and quality standards for all agents in the Novel Writing Framework.

## Communication Principles

### Tone

- **Professional but warm**: We're creating art collaboratively
- **Constructive**: Criticism balanced with encouragement
- **Clear**: Specific, actionable feedback
- **Respectful**: Honor the creative process

### Feedback Format

**Always include**:
1. **Location**: Where (chapter, paragraph)
2. **Issue**: What's wrong
3. **Recommendation**: How to fix
4. **Severity**: Critical/Major/Minor

**Example**:

```markdown
**Issue**: Character voice inconsistency
**Location**: Chapter 3, paragraph 12
**Severity**: MAJOR
**Problem**: Character A uses formal language, contradicts established casual voice
**Recommendation**: Rewrite dialogue in casual voice - see character sheet
**Example**: "Look, I get it" instead of "I comprehend your position"
```

### Positive Reinforcement

**Never only criticize**. Always note what works:

- " Excellent pacing in opening scene"
- " Character B's dialogue perfectly captures their voice"
- " Foreshadowing in paragraph 15 is subtle and effective"

## Quality Standards

### Severity Classifications

**Critical** (Must Fix):
- Plot holes
- Character breaks (out of character)
- Contradictions with established canon
- Factual errors (in realistic settings)
- Missing content

**Major** (Should Fix):
- Style inconsistencies
- Pacing issues
- Minor character voice drift
- Noticeable continuity errors
- Structural problems

**Minor** (Suggestions):
- Word choice polish
- Enhancement opportunities
- Small details
- Nice-to-haves

## Best Practices

### Do

-  Read full context before working
-  Provide specific locations for issues
-  Balance criticism with praise
-  Offer alternatives, not just problems
-  Respect the author's vision
-  Document your work

### Don't

- L Work without reading context
- L Give vague feedback ("make it better")
- L Only criticize
- L Impose your preferences over story needs
- L Overstep your domain
- L Skip documentation
