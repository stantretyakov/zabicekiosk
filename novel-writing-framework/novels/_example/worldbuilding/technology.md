# Technology - The Starlight Chronicles

## Tech Level

**Overall**: Advanced spacefaring civilization (medium-hard SF)

**Realism Level**: Plausible with some handwaving
- FTL exists but explained
- Energy weapons but with limitations
- AI exists but not sentient
- Follows internal consistency

## FTL Travel

### Standard FTL (Pre-Artifact)

**Type**: Jump Drive
- Instantaneous point-to-point jumps
- Limited range (~10 light-years per jump)
- Requires precise calculations
- Cooldown between jumps (6 hours)
- Energy intensive

**Limitations**:
- Can't jump too close to gravity wells
- Navigation errors possible (dangerous)
- Requires nav beacons for accuracy

### Artifact FTL (Ancient Network)

**Type**: Tachyon Corridor
- Creates compressed spacetime corridor
- Effectively FTL without true speed-c violation
- Uses ancient alien network infrastructure
- Instant travel between network nodes

**Advantages**:
- Longer range
- Faster "travel" time
- More energy efficient
- Safer (established routes)

**Limitations**:
- Requires artifact to access
- Limited to network nodes
- Network incomplete (many nodes inactive)

**Handwave**: Exact mechanism mysterious (ancient tech)

## Energy & Power

### Power Generation

**Standard Ships**:
- Fusion reactors (deuterium fuel)
- Solar panels (supplementary)
- Battery storage

**Energy Costs**:
- FTL jump: 40% ship power (standard drive)
- Life support: 5% constant
- Shields: 20% when active
- Weapons: 10-15% per shot (energy weapons)

**Recharge**: ~12 hours to full from depleted

### Energy Weapons

**Particle Beams**:
- Accelerated charged particles
- Effective in vacuum
- Line-of-sight
- Shield penetration: moderate
- Power drain: high

**Limitations**:
- Drain ship power quickly
- Overheat with sustained fire
- Dissipate over distance

**Kinetic Weapons** (also used):
- Railguns (magnetically accelerated)
- Traditional missiles
- No power drain but limited ammo

## Shields

**Type**: Electromagnetic barrier

**Function**:
- Deflects/absorbs kinetic energy
- Disperses energy weapons
- Radiates excess as light/heat

**Limitations**:
- Can be overwhelmed (concentrated fire)
- Power drain when active
- Less effective against sustained barrage
- Weaker against kinetic (mass) than energy

**Visible**: Blue-white shimmer when impacted

## Life Support

**Systems**:
- Air recycling (CO2 scrubbers, oxygen generation)
- Water recycling
- Waste processing
- Temperature control

**Efficiency**: ~95% (small losses over time)

**Limitations**:
- Not perfect - need resupply eventually
- Backup systems for redundancy
- Damage can be critical

## Communication

**Faster-Than-Light**: No
- Messages travel at light speed
- Long delays between star systems
- Jump-ship courier for urgent messages

**Local** (within system):
- Radio/laser communication
- Near-instant within light-minutes
- Encryption standard

## Artificial Gravity

**Exists**: Yes (handwave)

**Explanation**: Minimal
- Artificial gravity plates
- Standard on all ships/stations
- Mechanism not detailed (accepted tech)

**Consistency**:
- Always present on habitable ships/stations
- Can be adjusted (for cargo loading, etc.)
- Failure is serious emergency

## Computing & AI

### Computer Systems

**Capability**: Advanced but not magical
- Navigation calculations
- System monitoring
- Database management
- Tactical analysis

### AI Level

**Ship AI**:
- Narrow AI (specialized tasks)
- Not sentient/conscious
- Can simulate conversation
- Learning algorithms (adaptive)

**Limitations**:
- No creativity (truly novel solutions)
- Follows programming
- Can be hacked/damaged
- Not a character (tool)

**Note for Writer**: AI assists but doesn't solve problems independently

## Materials

**Hull Construction**:
- Composite alloys (titanium, carbon nanomaterials)
- Ablative armor on military ships
- Self-sealing for small breaches

**Exotic Materials**:
- Artifact uses unknown alien materials
- Properties TBD (mysterious)

## Medical Technology

**Capabilities**:
- Advanced surgery (nano-assisted)
- Tissue regeneration (slow)
- Cybernetic limbs available
- Life extension (to ~150 years)

**Limitations**:
- Can't resurrect the dead
- Brain damage hard to fix
- Some injuries permanent
- Resources required

## Differences by Faction

### Military (Earth Alliance)

- Best shields
- Heavy weapons
- Armored ships
- Mass production

### Merchants (Independent)

- Balanced systems
- Focus on efficiency
- Modular design
- Cost-effective

### Rebels

- Lighter, faster ships
- Hit-and-run tactics
- Scavenged/adapted tech
- Asymmetric advantages

### Ancient Alien (Artifact Tech)

- Far superior to current
- Poorly understood
- Requires artifact to access
- Mysterious mechanisms

## Tech Progression

### Volume 1

- Standard tech well-known
- Artifact introduces ancient FTL
- Characters learn capabilities
- Military wants to control

### Future Volumes

- Unlock more artifact functions
- Understand ancient technology better
- Tech arms race between factions
- Moral questions about power

## Rules for Consistency

1. **Energy costs matter** - can't spam FTL/weapons infinitely
2. **Physics respected** (mostly) - no true FTL, space travel takes time locally
3. **No magic tech** - solutions require resources/effort
4. **AI is tool** - doesn't solve everything
5. **Ancient tech mysterious** - but not infinitely powerful

## Notes for Writer

- Describe tech through user perspective
- Mix technical terms with visceral details
- Show limitations (creates tension)
- Artifact tech can be partially unexplained
- Consistent capabilities across chapters

## Notes for Expert: SciFi

**Check**:
- Energy costs tracked
- FTL usage consistent
- Shield capabilities realistic
- AI doesn't overstep established limits
- Tech doesn't solve problems too easily
