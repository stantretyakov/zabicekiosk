# Chapter 1: Ordinary World - Author Prompt

## Author's Vision

Introduce protagonist Akira in his everyday life as a mining engineer on Colony 7. Establish his character, routines, relationships, and hint at the larger story to come. This is the "ordinary world" before the adventure begins - ground the reader in normalcy so the extraordinary has impact.

## Key Points

- **Setting**: Mining colony on frontier planet, working-class environment
- **Character Introduction**: Show Akira's technical skills, curiosity about alien ruins, and restlessness
- **Daily Life**: Mining work, interacting with coworkers, sending messages home to family
- **Hint at Larger Story**: Ancient ruins on the planet, something is about to be discovered
- **Emotional Tone**: Routine with underlying sense of potential

## Characters Involved

- **Akira Tanaka**: Protagonist, show his personality through actions and thoughts
- **Supervisor Chen**: Brief appearance, represents authority/job
- **Yuki** (via message): Sister on colony, family connection
- **Coworker(s)**: Optional, show Akira's social dynamics

## Mood/Tone

- **Overall**: Calm before the storm, everyday life
- **Akira's POV**: Slightly restless, dreams of more
- **Sensory**: Industrial sounds, dust, machinery - make colony feel real
- **Pacing**: Moderate, immersive, establishing

## Specific Requirements

### Must Include

1. **Akira at work**: Show him as competent engineer, problem-solver
2. **Alien ruins reference**: Foreshadowing, his fascination with them
3. **Family connection**: Message or thought about mother/sister (motivation)
4. **Colony setting**: Establish frontier environment, hard work
5. **End hook**: Something changes, discovery imminent (setup for Chapter 2)

### Character Elements to Establish

- Engineering expertise
- Curiosity/intellectual side
- Loyalty to family
- Practical but idealistic
- Japanese cultural background (subtle)

### Worldbuilding to Introduce

- Mining colony environment
- Ancient alien ruins exist
- Technology level (standard, not artifact yet)
- Frontier life (hard but hopeful)

## Scene Structure Suggestion

1. **Opening**: Akira working on mining equipment, show technical skill
2. **Routine**: Daily tasks, interactions with coworkers/supervisor
3. **Personal Moment**: Message from sister or reflection on ruins
4. **Hook/Transition**: Discovery announcement or assignment to new site (leads to Ch2)

## Length

Target ~5,000-7,000 words (standard chapter length)

## Style Notes

- **POV**: Close third-person (Akira's perspective)
- **Narrative Voice**: Light novel style - accessible, some internal monologue
- **Technical Details**: Include but make accessible, Akira explains to himself/others
- **Pacing**: Mix description, action, reflection
- **Show > Tell**: Demonstrate Akira's character through actions/thoughts

## What to Avoid

- Info dumps about world history (introduce naturally)
- Too much exposition in dialogue ("As you know, Bob...")
- Making Akira too special yet (he's ordinary at this point)
- Rushing - let the ordinary world breathe

## Connection to Overall Story

This chapter establishes:
- Who Akira is before transformation
- What he has to lose (home, family, routine)
- What he desires (exploration, discovery, meaning)
- The world he inhabits (colony life, frontier)

Sets up contrast for when artifact discovery disrupts everything (Chapter 2+).

## Notes for Writer

- Reference character sheet for Akira's traits, speech patterns
- Check worldbuilding/technology.md for tech descriptions
- This is setup - make it engaging, not just functional
- End with reader wanting to know what happens next

## Example Opening (Optional)

*You can use this as inspiration or ignore completely:*

"The mining drill whined in protest, its harmonic oscillator out of alignment again. Akira Tanaka crouched beside the massive machine, diagnostic scanner in hand, and sighed. Third time this week. The colony-issued equipment wasn't built for the mineral density on Colony 7..."
